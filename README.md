# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository documents the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system. It serves as a comprehensive blueprint that outlines the process of gathering, analyzing, and documenting software requirements to ensure successful project execution. Through structured documentation and visual representations, this project demonstrates industry-standard practices for requirement analysis in the software development lifecycle.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

Requirement Analysis is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that involves systematically identifying, documenting, and validating the needs and constraints of stakeholders for a software system. It serves as the foundation upon which the entire project is built.

This process transforms vague business ideas and user needs into precise, measurable, and testable specifications. Requirement Analysis ensures that developers understand exactly what to build, while stakeholders have clear expectations about the final product's functionality and behavior.

Key aspects of requirement analysis include:
- Understanding business objectives and user needs
- Translating abstract requirements into concrete specifications
- Identifying constraints and dependencies
- Establishing clear communication channels between stakeholders and development teams
- Creating a baseline for project planning and estimation

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is crucial in SDLC for several key reasons:

### 1. Prevents Project Failures and Cost Overruns
- Identifies potential issues and ambiguities early in the development process
- Reduces the need for expensive changes during later stages
- Studies show that fixing requirements errors during analysis is 100x cheaper than fixing them in production

### 2. Ensures Stakeholder Alignment
- Creates a shared understanding among business stakeholders, users, and developers
- Establishes clear expectations and reduces misunderstandings
- Provides a reference point for resolving disputes about system functionality

### 3. Forms the Foundation for Quality Assurance
- Enables the creation of comprehensive test plans and acceptance criteria
- Facilitates traceability from requirements to test cases
- Ensures the final product meets both functional and non-functional expectations

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

### Requirement Gathering
The process of collecting information about the system requirements from various stakeholders including users, business owners, and subject matter experts. Techniques include interviews, surveys, workshops, and observation.

### Requirement Elicitation
Actively extracting and discovering requirements that stakeholders may not explicitly state. This involves understanding underlying business needs, user pain points, and unspoken expectations through techniques like prototyping and user story mapping.

### Requirement Documentation
Systematically recording requirements in structured formats such as Software Requirements Specification (SRS) documents, user stories, and use cases. This creates a single source of truth for the development team.

### Requirement Analysis and Modeling
Breaking down complex requirements into manageable components and creating visual models. This includes data flow diagrams, entity-relationship diagrams, state transition diagrams, and use case models to represent system behavior.

### Requirement Validation
Ensuring that requirements are complete, consistent, achievable, and testable. This involves reviews with stakeholders, feasibility analysis, and conflict resolution to confirm that requirements accurately represent stakeholder needs.

## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements
Functional requirements define what the system should do - the specific behaviors and functions that the system must perform.

**Examples for Booking Management System:**
- Users shall be able to search for available rooms by date range and room type
- The system shall allow users to make reservations for available rooms
- Users shall be able to view and modify their existing bookings
- The system shall process payments for confirmed bookings
- Administrators shall be able to manage room inventory and pricing
- The system shall send confirmation emails upon successful booking
- Users shall be able to cancel reservations according to cancellation policies

### Non-functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements define how the system performs its functions - the quality attributes and constraints of the system.

**Examples for Booking Management System:**
- **Performance:** The system shall support 1000 concurrent users with response times under 2 seconds
- **Availability:** The system shall maintain 99.9% uptime during business hours
- **Security:** All user data and payment information shall be encrypted using AES-256
- **Usability:** New users shall be able to complete a booking within 3 minutes without training
- **Scalability:** The system shall handle a 50% increase in user load during peak seasons
- **Reliability:** The system shall have data backup and recovery mechanisms with maximum 15-minute data loss
- **Compliance:** The system shall comply with GDPR regulations for data protection and privacy

## Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria are conditions that a software product must satisfy to be accepted by stakeholders. They define the boundaries of a user story and provide clear, testable conditions for completion.

### Importance of Acceptance Criteria
- Provide clear definition of done for development teams
- Enable accurate test case creation
- Reduce ambiguity in requirements
- Facilitate stakeholder sign-off
- Ensure delivered features meet business needs

### Example: Checkout Feature Acceptance Criteria

**Feature:** As a registered user, I want to complete the booking checkout process so that I can confirm my reservation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. **Given** the user has selected a room and dates, **when** they proceed to checkout, **then** the system shall display a summary of the booking details including room type, dates, total price, and taxes.

2. **Given** the user is at the checkout page, **when** they are not logged in, **then** the system shall prompt them to login or continue as guest.

3. **Given** the user is providing payment information, **when** they enter invalid credit card details, **then** the system shall display appropriate error messages and prevent form submission.

4. **Given** all required information is valid, **when** the user submits the payment, **then** the system shall process the payment through the secure payment gateway.

5. **Given** the payment is successful, **when** the booking is confirmed, **then** the system shall send a confirmation email to the user with booking details and reference number.

6. **Given** the payment fails, **when** the user retries payment, **then** the system shall allow up to 3 payment attempts before locking the booking for 15 minutes.

7. **Given** the checkout process is completed successfully, **then** the system shall update room availability and create a booking record in the database.
